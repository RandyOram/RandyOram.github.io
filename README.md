## About The Project

![randyoram.com](http://randyoram.com/sample.png)

randyoram.com is my personal website. Its primary purpose is to act as a virtual business card, containing a quick introduction, my r√©sum√©, contact information, and my "for fun" projects.

I started work on randyoram.com as early as May of 2018. I was only three semesters into my Computer Science education, and wanted to start doing fun things, so I followed a tutorial to make animated confetti with javascript. I loved how it turned out, so I wanted to share. I felt that it needed something to go with it, so I coded a simple tic-tac-toe application. Then I had to figure out how to host! That's where GitHub pages came in. I bought my domain and added one simple <a> tag pointing to my tic-tac-toe game.

Right after graduating in May of 2019, I decided to transform it into a business-card style website. I had developed a love for processing.js (an animation library), and I really enjoy hexagons and the color orange, so I created a background combining all three of these things. I made a card and animated it so it flips to reveal contact information on the back!

## Projects

One of the major purposes of this website is to host my sandbox projects. All of these are animation-style projects, 3 of which use Processing.js. I have more projects, such as Space Trace, which are not showcased here yet.

1. Tic-Tac-Toe

‚ùå‚≠ïüéâ This project was my first JavaScript project. Originally, I just wanted to create some confetti with Processing.js. However, I felt that it needed something to complement it. So I created Tic-Tac-Toe. I think the biggest challenge was figuring out how to create a board and put text into it without altering the size of the board. Another thing I had to tackle was the algorithm to check for a win. It probably isn't the best, but I didn't have much algorithm knowledge at the time!

2. LiteBrite

üí°üîπ‚ô¶Ô∏è A virtual LiteBrite! I created this following the educational project from CodeAcademy. I did this as an exercise in Javascript, hoping to strengthen my skills.

3. New Years Countdown

üí•üß®üéÜ Fireworks! I I saw this somewhere and decided to figure out how to program it. I followed a similar tutorial from The Coding Train to create the fireworks. Then I created a countdown script that displays the data and counts down to the new year in seconds. Originally, the fireworks would fire as soon as the ball dropped and keep running for the remainder of January. February came along and I missed my fireworks, so I made them happen year-round!

4. Pong

üéÆüéæüèÖ One of the earliest video games (is it the earliest?)! I was going to make Snake, but quickly decided that Pong would be more exciting. It seems pretty simple, but it's actually a bit of a trick to get both paddles moving at the same time, and to get them to change directions and work as expected. I also had to set boundaries for the ball and paddles, then create a score-tracker. Finally, I realized the game had no instructions, so I threw on a display showing which buttons worked each paddle.

<!-- KNOWN BUGS -->
## Known Bugs

* When I was creating this site, I tried to go for a responsive design. I almost nailed it! It looked great when I was testing with Chrome DevKit (viewing it on all sorts of different devices), but it turns out this doesn't actually reflect what it looks like on the actual devices. When I first opened it up on my phone, I was sad to see that the card was slightly distorted and off-center. I will fix this when I eventually port the website over to React!

* The tool-tip pop-ups seem to be glitchy on mobile. They don't disappear after clicking a button! I think this could be fixed by disabling tooltips for mobile, but I haven't looked into it yet.

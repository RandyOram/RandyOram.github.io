## About The Project

![randyoram.com](http://randyoram.com/sample.png)

randyoram.com is my personal website. Its primary purpose is to act as a virtual business card, containing a quick introduction, my résumé, contact information, and my "for fun" projects.

I started work on randyoram.com as early as May of 2018. I was only three semesters into my Computer Science education, and wanted to start doing fun things, so I followed a tutorial to make animated confetti with javascript. I loved how it turned out, so I wanted to share. I felt that it needed something to go with it, so I coded a simple tic-tac-toe application. Then I had to figure out how to host! That's where GitHub pages came in. I bought my domain and added one simple <a> tag pointing to my tic-tac-toe game.

Right after graduating in May of 2019, I decided to transform it into a business-card style website. I had developed a love for processing.js (an animation library), and I really enjoy hexagons and the color orange, so I created a background combining all three of these things. I made a card and animated it so it flips to reveal contact information on the back!

<!-- KNOWN BUGS -->
## Known Bugs

* When I was creating this site, I tried to go for a responsive design. I almost nailed it! It looked great when I was testing with Chrome DevKit (viewing it on all sorts of different devices), but it turns out this doesn't actually reflect what it looks like on the actual devices. When I first opened it up on my phone, I was sad to see that the card was slightly distorted and off-center. I will fix this when I eventually port the website over to React!

* The tool-tip pop-ups seem to be glitchy on mobile. They don't disappear after clicking a button! I think this could be fixed by disabling tooltips for mobile, but I haven't looked into it yet.
